<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to the World of Zugra project page.</h3>

<p>We have brought this game to life on a few various test servers and have worked out majority of the kinks. At this point we have decided to begin bringing the code to github in order to recieve great insights from talented individuals around the world. As we create new modules to the game we invite you to take a look at our repositories and make suggestions to make this game all the better.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Story Line</h3>

<p>We originally visioned a game where the players would have significant amounts of input as to how the story unfolds. For this reason it makes our decision to begin using github on this project all the more valuable. If you have any suggestions on the storyline we invite you to submit anything that may possibly add sparking detail to the game. </p>
<p>As it currently goes the World of Zugra is an alternate dimension where the means of travel are almost magical using a process of navagation resembling teleportation in order to navigate between various lands. There are three races of humanoid found in this place consisting of Dwarf, Human, and Elf. </p>

<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Pet Module</h3>

<p>The most recent addition to this project is a pet module. This is being programmed in such a way that the entire pet system will fit seemlessly into the current world of zugra game and if taken out will not cause problems. This is typically the whole idea to modular programming. Anywho, the current project will allow players to adopt and raise pets for their characters in zugra having the power to name the pet at the time of adoption, send the pet into combat against opponents that are met, and we intend to add a few quests that will work especially nicely with the addition of pets. To see the progress of this module simply keep an eye on the repository.</p>

 <p>This is an entire new thing to me at this point so please have a little patience and I will be attempting to get this project up to par as quickly as possible.
